# "makeCacheMatrix" creates a special "matrix", which is
# really a list containing a function to
#  1.  set the value of the matrix
#  2.  get the value of the matrix
#  3.  set the value of the inverse of a matrix
#  4.  get the value of the inverse of a matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    s <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        s <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(solve) s <<- solve
    getinverse <- function() s
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}


# "cacheSolve" calculates the inverse of of the special "matrix"
# created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the
# inverse has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the inverse from the
# cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of
# the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the `setinverse`
# function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
   ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    s <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(s)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(s)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    s <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(s)
    s
}
